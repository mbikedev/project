# 🚨 URGENT: Fix Email Configuration

## Current Issue
Your reservation system is working perfectly, but emails aren't sending because the Resend API key is not configured in Supabase.

## Quick Fix (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get Resend API Key
1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com) and create a free account
2. Navigate to **API Keys** in the dashboard
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Name it: `EastAtWest-Restaurant`
5. Copy the API key (starts with `re_`)

### Step 2: Configure Supabase Edge Function
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Edge Functions** → **Settings** (or **Functions** → **Settings**)
3. Look for **Environment Variables** or **Secrets**
4. Add a new environment variable:
   - **Name**: `RESEND_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: [Paste your Resend API key here]
5. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Test Immediately
1. Make a test reservation in your app
2. You should now receive a professional confirmation email
3. Check your email inbox (including spam folder)

## What Happens After Setup

✅ **Immediate Benefits:**
- Customers receive beautiful confirmation emails
- Emails sent in customer's preferred language (EN/FR/NL)
- Professional restaurant branding
- Complete reservation details included

✅ **Email Content Includes:**
- Reservation number and status
- Date, time, and guest count
- Restaurant contact information
- Status-specific instructions
- Professional East At West branding

## Domain Setup (Optional - For Custom Email Address)

If you want emails to come from `reservations@eastatwest.com` instead of Resend's default:

1. In Resend dashboard, go to **Domains**
2. Click **Add Domain**
3. Enter: `eastatwest.com`
4. Follow DNS verification steps
5. Add the provided DNS records to your domain

**Note:** The system works immediately with Resend's default sending domain. Custom domain setup can be done later.

## Current Status

🟡 **Reservations**: ✅ Working perfectly  
🟡 **Database**: ✅ All data saved correctly  
🟡 **Confirmation**: ✅ In-app confirmations working  
🔴 **Emails**: ❌ Blocked by missing API key  

**After setup**: All systems will be ✅ fully operational!

## Troubleshooting

If emails still don't work after adding the API key:

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for Supabase to apply the environment variable
2. **Check the API key** is correct (no extra spaces)
3. **Verify Resend account** is active and verified
4. **Test with a new reservation** (don't retry old ones)

## Support

The email system is professionally implemented with:
- Error handling and fallbacks
- Multi-language support
- Beautiful responsive design

Once the API key is configured, everything will work seamlessly!
